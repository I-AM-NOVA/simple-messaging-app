I already generate a permanent, unique userId for each registered user on the server.
I want each user’s contact list to store three things for each contact:

1. contactId — a unique identifier for the contact entry in that user’s list.


2. contactName — the name the user assigns to that contact (can be different from the actual username).


3. userId — the global permanent ID of the contact user.



I need:

A recommended database schema that supports this separation.

Example Node.js backend code to create and retrieve contacts without mixing up contactId, contactName, and userId.

A suggested client-side data structure and best practice for displaying contactName (falling back to username if missing).

Best practices for keeping userId as the primary identifier for system logic, while contactId is only for contact management.
